        "bio": "I'm a passionate developer and pentester who loves building and breaking things. My journey began in middle school, where my fascination with video games led me to learn coding through an abandoned Dragon Ball project. Since then, I've explored Java, Unity, and fully committed to development and cybersecurity after high school. I thrive on mastering new topics and created a micro-framework that marked my shift from coder to developer. I enjoy backend development for its challenges, and frontend for the joy of reproducing designs. Cybersecurity excites me for the thrill of hacking. Outside tech, I love video games, manga, chess, and basketball. Driven by curiosity, I aim to create impactful games and systems for Africa.",
